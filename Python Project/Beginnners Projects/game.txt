I went through Mrs Shears gate, closing it behind me.
I walked onto her lawn and knelt beside the dog.
I put my hand on the muzzle of the dog. It was still warm.
The dog was called Wellington. It belonged to Mrs Shears who was our friend.
She lived on the opposite side of the road, two houses to the left.
Wellington was a poodle. Not one of the small poodles that have hairstyles but a big poodle.
It had curly black fur, but when you got close you could see that the skin underneath the fur was a very pale yellow, like chicken.
I stroked Wellington and wondered who had killed him, and why.
Siobhan read the first page and said that it was different.
She put this word into inverted commas by making the wiggly quotation sign with her first and second fingers.
She said that it was usually people who were killed in murder mystery novels.
I said that two dogs were killed in The Hound of the Baskervilles.
The hound itself and James Mortimer’s spaniel, but Siobhan said they weren’t the victims of the murder.
Sir Charles Baskerville was.
She said that this was because readers cared more about people than dogs.
So if a person was killed in the book readers would want to carry on reading.
